## Problem 1 — Personal Website

My personal website for this assignment is available at:  
<https://YutongMao.github.io>

This website contains a landing page, a resume page, and navigation
links to my GitHub and email as required by the assignment.

## Problem 2 – Interactive Dashboard

My interactive dashboard for NYC restaurant inspections is included in
the file  
[`hw4_dashboard.Rmd`](hw4_dashboard.Rmd) and can be viewed by knitting
it to `hw4_dashboard.html`.

The dashboard visualizes: - **Grade composition by borough** -
**Inspection score distribution by cuisine** - **Relationship between
violations and inspection scores** - **Monthly trends in inspection
scores**
